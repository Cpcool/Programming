# BitFlyer Problem solution
We can solve this problem by first three methods 
1) Using Recursive approch + Bitmasking + branch and bound
2) Using Bitmasking 
3) Top-Down DP  ->  We can also use this technique to improve the complexity of first approach
4) Bottom Up DP ->  As our Maximum Byte size is very large no so can't use Bottom up
